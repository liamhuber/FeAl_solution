All calculations were performed within the \code{pyiron}~\cite{pyiron, pyiron-paper} framework driving \code{LAMMPS}~\cite{lammps, plimpton1995fast} to evaluate forces and energies and run the molecular dynamics calculations.
The coupled Monte Carlo/MD calculations were performed using the Variance-Constrained Semi-Grand-Canonical (VCSGC) framework provided as a \code{fix} in \code{LAMMPS} by Sadigh \etal~\cite{sadigh2012calculation, sadigh2012scalable}.
The atomic interactions are described by the embedded atom method (EAM) potentials of Mendelev \etal~\cite{mendelev2005effect} and Farkas and Caro \cite{farkas2020model}, and the modified EAM (MEAM) potentials of Lee and Lee~\cite{lee2010modified} and Jelenik \etal~\cite{jelinek2012modified}.
The full code for reproducing these results (at least stochastically) can be found on \code{github}~\cite{feal}.
